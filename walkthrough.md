**Some notes about the walkthrough:**  
- To follow this walkthrough perfectly you'll need the Improvements Mod. The mod fixes how the event system works, so some events won't be available if you are not using the mod.
- Many choices in the game don't give you the best possible scene outcome and some scenes have requirements that are easy to miss, which means you can easily get a version of a scene that has less content. That's the reason I made this guide, so if you follow it you'll get 100% of the scenes and content in the game and don't have to worry about missing anything.
- If there is a choice that isn't mentioned in the walkthrough that means it's a choice that doesn't affect anything and you can choose any option.

### Waifu location schedule:
The girls will always be in their room, the pool, or the bathroom when it is morning and night, but leave the house at noon. However if there is a relationship event that causes them to be somewhere else then they will be there instead of their normal location.
